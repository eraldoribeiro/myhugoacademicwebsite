	 through the modal analysis of the pattern of peaks in the spectral
	 density function. We commence from a texture characterisation which is
	 based on the positions of peaks in the power spectrum. Our aim is to
	 use the modal structure of the pattern of peaks to perform texture
	 retrieval from an image data-base. We explore two different approaches
	 to the problem. First, we use a variant of the Shapiro and Brady,
	 method to perform recognition by comparing the modal structure of the
	 proximity matrix for peak cluster centres. Second, we perform latent
	 semantic indexing on vectors representing the polar distribution
	 of frequency peaks. We provide an experimental evaluation of these
	 two methods on a data-base of fabric and wrapping paper patterns.},
