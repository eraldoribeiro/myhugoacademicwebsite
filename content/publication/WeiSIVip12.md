# Abstract and optional shortened version.
abstract = "In this paper, we use image moments to solve the problem of estimating deformation fields given a pair of images as input. We use a single family of polynomials to parameterize the deformation field and to define image moments. In this way, variations in image moments can be represented by a set of linear equations. We solve these equations iteratively for the deformation parameters between two shapes. Our approach improves existing moment-based registration methods in both robustness to noise and convergence rate. In addition, our method does not rely on solving the correspondence problem. We have extensively tested our new method on both synthetically deformed MPEG-7 shapes and real-world biomedical images."
