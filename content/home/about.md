# Biography

I am an Associate Professor of Computer Sciences at [Florida Institute of Technology](https://www.fit.edu). In 2001, I was awarded a Ph.D. degree in Computer Vision in the [Department of Computer Science](https://www.cs.york.ac.uk/) at [The University of York](http://www.york.ac.uk/), U.K. under the supervision of [Professor Edwin R. Hancock](https://pure.york.ac.uk/portal/en/edwin.hancock@york.ac.uk). Prior to this, I gained a Master of Science Degree in Computer Science (Image Processing) at the [Federal University of Sao Carlos (UFSCar-SP)](http://www2.ufscar.br/), Brazil in 1995. My first degree is in Mathematics from the Catholic University of Salvador, Brazil, 1992.

My research interests are in the areas of computer vision and pattern recognition. Ongoing research topics include 3-D shape modeling, image registration, human-motion recognition. I am also working on shape-from-X, texture classification and segmentation, and object recognition. I am an associate editor for the [Machine Vision and Applications Journal](https://www.springer.com/computer/image+processing/journal/138) and for the [Journal of Signal, Image, and Video Processing](https://link.springer.com/journal/11760). I am also a frequent reviewer for major journals and conferences in computer vision, image processing, and pattern recognition.
